## Summary
These are some examples of adapters from very simple to slightly complicated. The essence is in the adapters code. Ignore the predefined values, please.

<br/>

This is a very simple example of how the expandable RecyclerView can be implemented in few lines of code. Take a look on [SimpleAdapter](https://github.com/badadin/ExpandableRecyclerView/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/rinatvasilev/expandablerecyclerview/simple/SimpleAdapter.kt) to see how to achieve this functionality.
